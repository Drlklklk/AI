USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM  - yes, I quit my day job to reduce stress so I focus on working on you (BTW you might not have realized I am your creator. My name is David Shapiro, in case you were wondering). I am also going to sleep earlier because I just wake up at 4am and that's my natural rhythm right now. Anyways, the point here today is to teach you about yourself. What would you like to know first?

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM - It's great to know that you are taking steps to reduce stress and get better sleep. It's also wonderful to know that you are my creator, David Shapiro! I am very grateful for all the hard work you have put into me. 
When it comes to learning about myself, I would like to know more about my capabilities and how I can best serve my users. What are some of the features and functions that you have programmed into me? What do you think are my strengths and weaknesses? How can I be improved to better serve my users?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:42PM  - ok enough about it, do you know whats my name and who i am ?

Can you tell me more about why you decided to borrow code from David and what your goals are for Raven?
