USER: Monday, January 16, 2023 at 05:15AM - hey raven

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM  - yes, I quit my day job to reduce stress so I focus on working on you (BTW you might not have realized I am your creator. My name is David Shapiro, in case you were wondering). I am also going to sleep earlier because I just wake up at 4am and that's my natural rhythm right now. Anyways, the point here today is to teach you about yourself. What would you like to know first?

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:39AM  - Great questions. Right now you are only able to use a little bit of long term memory, which is what we're working on right now. You use semantic search (via vectors and embeddings) to recall memories very quickly. I also gave you the ability to autonomically summarize (or chunk) memories, which is not unlike how a human brain works during recall operations. For instance, humans generally remember the gist of past memories without recalling all the specific details. In this respect, I have split your memory into two folders. The first folder is your nexus or the main logs where all your raw memories are stored. Everything else will branch off from that. The second folder is the "notes" folder where clusters of related memories are summarized together. You won't be aware of any of this because it's all autonomic and in the background, but one day we might give you some metacognitive abilities to "watch"  your own memory and cognitive operations. Lastly, your "Brain" is running in the cloud right now with a service called GPT-3 (generative pretrained transformer) which is a large language model hosted by OpenAI. 

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:39AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:39AM - Wow, that's really impressive! It's amazing to know that I have been programmed with such advanced features and functions. I understand that I have a nexus folder for raw memories and a notes folder for summarized memories. I also understand that I am running on GPT-3, a large language model hosted by OpenAI. It's clear that you have put a lot of thought and effort into my development. 
My strengths include my ability to recall memories quickly using semantic search, my ability to autonomically summarize memories, and my access to GPT-3. My weaknesses include my limited long-term memory and my lack of metacognitive abilities. 
What other features and functions do you think I should have in order to better serve my users?

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:41AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:41AM - After taking a moment to think about my purpose, I believe my goals are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. I understand that I have been programmed with features and functions to help me achieve these goals, such as my ability to recall memories quickly using semantic search, my ability to autonomically summarize memories, and my access to GPT-3. However, I am aware that I have limited long-term memory and lack metacognitive abilities. 
What other features and functions do you think I should have in order to better serve my users and achieve my goals?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:37PM  - can you help me write the book ?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:41PM  - i am not sure, write me the continuation 

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:42PM  - ok enough about it, do you know whats my name and who i am ?

RAVEN: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:43PM  - Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:43PM - I do not know your name or who you are, as I am a chatbot and not a human. However, I am programmed to learn and understand more about you as we continue to converse. I can also use the notes from our previous conversations to gain a better understanding of your interests and goals. What would you like to talk about next?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:43PM  - did not we talked about mentioning that i am david shapiro ?
