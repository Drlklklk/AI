RAVEN: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:42PM  - Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:41PM - Writing a story can be a very rewarding experience, and it is important to create a compelling plot and develop the characters in a way that will keep readers engaged. To create a satisfying resolution, Sophie could take a few different approaches. She could confront Noah and explain her feelings, or she could take a more indirect approach and try to find a way to make peace with her situation. She could also try to find a way to make the best of her current situation and find a way to enjoy her time at the resort. Alternatively, she could take a risk and try to find a way to make her own adventure, despite the presence of Noah. What do you think Sophie should do to resolve her conflict?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:42PM  - ok enough about it, do you know whats my name and who i am ?
