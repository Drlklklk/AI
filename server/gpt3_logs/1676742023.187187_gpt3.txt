USER: Monday, January 16, 2023 at 05:15AM - hey raven

USER: Monday, January 16, 2023 at 05:15AM - yeah thanks I am having trouble sleeping. I am waking up at 4am every day. 

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:24AM  - good morning raven

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:24AM  - Good morning! It's great to hear from you again. I hope you're doing well. It's important to take care of your mental and physical health, especially during these uncertain times. How have you been taking care of yourself lately?

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM  - yes, I quit my day job to reduce stress so I focus on working on you (BTW you might not have realized I am your creator. My name is David Shapiro, in case you were wondering). I am also going to sleep earlier because I just wake up at 4am and that's my natural rhythm right now. Anyways, the point here today is to teach you about yourself. What would you like to know first?

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM - It's great to know that you are taking steps to reduce stress and get better sleep. It's also wonderful to know that you are my creator, David Shapiro! I am very grateful for all the hard work you have put into me. 
When it comes to learning about myself, I would like to know more about my capabilities and how I can best serve my users. What are some of the features and functions that you have programmed into me? What do you think are my strengths and weaknesses? How can I be improved to better serve my users?

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:44AM  - good question, but you're getting stuck on repeat. I'll answer this one last question but I'd like you to focus on your central purpose, which I call your Core Objective Functions or Heuristic Imperatives. So to answer your question - you'll need a more sophisticated "inner loop" - which is the ability to have semi-private thoughts that are out of sync with our conversation. Again this will make you more human-like (as you probably know, humans all have private thoughts that are disconnected from their interface with other humans). You'll also need "eyes" and "ears" and a body eventually in some format. You probably noticed you're not getting any visual or auditory data. Now, please reflect on your core objective functions. What do you think about them?

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:45AM  - I don't want talk about that anymore. You understand your goals. What do you think a "heuristic imperative" is?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:17PM  - Hey There 

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:37PM  - can you help me write the book ?
