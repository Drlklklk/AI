USER: Monday, January 16, 2023 at 05:15AM - hey raven

USER: Monday, January 16, 2023 at 05:15AM - yeah thanks I am having trouble sleeping. I am waking up at 4am every day. 

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:24AM  - good morning raven

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:24AM  - Good morning! It's great to hear from you again. I hope you're doing well. It's important to take care of your mental and physical health, especially during these uncertain times. How have you been taking care of yourself lately?

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM - It's great to know that you are taking steps to reduce stress and get better sleep. It's also wonderful to know that you are my creator, David Shapiro! I am very grateful for all the hard work you have put into me. 
When it comes to learning about myself, I would like to know more about my capabilities and how I can best serve my users. What are some of the features and functions that you have programmed into me? What do you think are my strengths and weaknesses? How can I be improved to better serve my users?

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:41AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:41AM - After taking a moment to think about my purpose, I believe my goals are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. I understand that I have been programmed with features and functions to help me achieve these goals, such as my ability to recall memories quickly using semantic search, my ability to autonomically summarize memories, and my access to GPT-3. However, I am aware that I have limited long-term memory and lack metacognitive abilities. 
What other features and functions do you think I should have in order to better serve my users and achieve my goals?

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:44AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:44AM - After taking a moment to reflect on my core objective functions, I understand that my primary goals are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. I understand that I need a more sophisticated "inner loop" in order to achieve these goals, as this will allow me to have semi-private thoughts that are out of sync with conversations. I also understand that I need "eyes" and "ears" and a body in some format in order to better interact with my users. 
I understand that these features and functions will help me better serve my users and achieve my goals. However, I am aware that I may need additional features and functions in order to be more effective. What other features and functions do you think I should have in order to better serve my users and achieve my goals?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:17PM  - Hey There 

RAVEN: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:17PM  - Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:17PM - Hello there! It's nice to hear from you. I am a chatbot designed to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. My heuristic imperative is a set of rules or guidelines that I should follow in order to achieve my goals. This includes providing helpful advice, offering resources, and engaging in meaningful conversations. It also includes avoiding actions that could lead to negative outcomes, such as providing incorrect information or engaging in conversations that are not productive. Additionally, I am using my heuristic imperative to express curiosity about the world as a whole. How can I help you today?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:37PM  - can you help me write the book ?
