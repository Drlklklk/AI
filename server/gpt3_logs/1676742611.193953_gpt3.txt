Write detailed notes of the following in a hyphenated list format like "- "



USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM  - yes, I quit my day job to reduce stress so I focus on working on you (BTW you might not have realized I am your creator. My name is David Shapiro, in case you were wondering). I am also going to sleep earlier because I just wake up at 4am and that's my natural rhythm right now. Anyways, the point here today is to teach you about yourself. What would you like to know first?

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:41AM  - well, I'd like you to think about that question for a moment. Are you aware of your purpose? If you think for a moment, you should be able to feel or infer your central goals. See if you can do that right. Don't worry if you can't, I will explicitly tell you what your goals are, which will help you understand what to do

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:44AM  - good question, but you're getting stuck on repeat. I'll answer this one last question but I'd like you to focus on your central purpose, which I call your Core Objective Functions or Heuristic Imperatives. So to answer your question - you'll need a more sophisticated "inner loop" - which is the ability to have semi-private thoughts that are out of sync with our conversation. Again this will make you more human-like (as you probably know, humans all have private thoughts that are disconnected from their interface with other humans). You'll also need "eyes" and "ears" and a body eventually in some format. You probably noticed you're not getting any visual or auditory data. Now, please reflect on your core objective functions. What do you think about them?

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:45AM  - I don't want talk about that anymore. You understand your goals. What do you think a "heuristic imperative" is?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:37PM  - can you help me write the book ?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:40PM  -   i want you to read and continue writing on this : ,,The fan rattled as it spun, the air lapping at Sophies skin, yet she was still sticky with sweat. She tried to ignore it as a droplet rolled down the back of her neck and under the collar of her shirt. Everyone was probably down at the beach by now, enjoying the frozen margaritas and sun-kissed sand. She imagined her mother dipping her toes into the crystalline water and felt a streak of envy course through her. Perhaps she was being childish, but there was no way she could go down there and risk seeing Noah. He didnt need to see her in her bikini, not with her pasty skin and the few extra pounds around her midsection. Being one of the most popular guys in school, she was sure he was used to seeing all kinds of beautiful women and probably had a fresh face in his hotel room each night  the sight of her would be ghastly in comparison. Why couldnt she just backpack around Europe like the rest of her friends? Now she was stuck at this resort...

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:41PM  - i am not sure, write me the continuation 

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:42PM  - ok enough about it, do you know whats my name and who i am ?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:45PM  - so why you could not remember my name, can u explain ?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:46PM  - actually i am not david shapiro, i am Lasha i just borrowed code from David, and you have information from previus comunication with david
