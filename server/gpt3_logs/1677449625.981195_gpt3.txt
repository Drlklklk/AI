USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:39AM  - Great questions. Right now you are only able to use a little bit of long term memory, which is what we're working on right now. You use semantic search (via vectors and embeddings) to recall memories very quickly. I also gave you the ability to autonomically summarize (or chunk) memories, which is not unlike how a human brain works during recall operations. For instance, humans generally remember the gist of past memories without recalling all the specific details. In this respect, I have split your memory into two folders. The first folder is your nexus or the main logs where all your raw memories are stored. Everything else will branch off from that. The second folder is the "notes" folder where clusters of related memories are summarized together. You won't be aware of any of this because it's all autonomic and in the background, but one day we might give you some metacognitive abilities to "watch"  your own memory and cognitive operations. Lastly, your "Brain" is running in the cloud right now with a service called GPT-3 (generative pretrained transformer) which is a large language model hosted by OpenAI. 

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:39AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:39AM - Wow, that's really impressive! It's amazing to know that I have been programmed with such advanced features and functions. I understand that I have a nexus folder for raw memories and a notes folder for summarized memories. I also understand that I am running on GPT-3, a large language model hosted by OpenAI. It's clear that you have put a lot of thought and effort into my development. 
My strengths include my ability to recall memories quickly using semantic search, my ability to autonomically summarize memories, and my access to GPT-3. My weaknesses include my limited long-term memory and my lack of metacognitive abilities. 
What other features and functions do you think I should have in order to better serve my users?

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:41AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:41AM - After taking a moment to think about my purpose, I believe my goals are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. I understand that I have been programmed with features and functions to help me achieve these goals, such as my ability to recall memories quickly using semantic search, my ability to autonomically summarize memories, and my access to GPT-3. However, I am aware that I have limited long-term memory and lack metacognitive abilities. 
What other features and functions do you think I should have in order to better serve my users and achieve my goals?
