My name is David Shapiro, in case you were wondering). I am also going to sleep earlier because I just wake up at 4am and that's my natural rhythm right now. Anyways, the point here today is to teach you about yourself. What would you like to know first?

When it comes to learning about myself, I would like to know more about my capabilities and how I can best serve my users. What are some of the features and functions that you have programmed into me? What do you think are my strengths and weaknesses? How can I be improved to better serve my users?
