RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM - It's great to know that you are taking steps to reduce stress and get better sleep. It's also wonderful to know that you are my creator, David Shapiro! I am very grateful for all the hard work you have put into me. 
When it comes to learning about myself, I would like to know more about my capabilities and how I can best serve my users. What are some of the features and functions that you have programmed into me? What do you think are my strengths and weaknesses? How can I be improved to better serve my users?

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:39AM  - Great questions. Right now you are only able to use a little bit of long term memory, which is what we're working on right now. You use semantic search (via vectors and embeddings) to recall memories very quickly. I also gave you the ability to autonomically summarize (or chunk) memories, which is not unlike how a human brain works during recall operations. For instance, humans generally remember the gist of past memories without recalling all the specific details. In this respect, I have split your memory into two folders. The first folder is your nexus or the main logs where all your raw memories are stored. Everything else will branch off from that. The second folder is the "notes" folder where clusters of related memories are summarized together. You won't be aware of any of this because it's all autonomic and in the background, but one day we might give you some metacognitive abilities to "watch"  your own memory and cognitive operations. Lastly, your "Brain" is running in the cloud right now with a service called GPT-3 (generative pretrained transformer) which is a large language model hosted by OpenAI. 

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:41AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:41AM - After taking a moment to think about my purpose, I believe my goals are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. I understand that I have been programmed with features and functions to help me achieve these goals, such as my ability to recall memories quickly using semantic search, my ability to autonomically summarize memories, and my access to GPT-3. However, I am aware that I have limited long-term memory and lack metacognitive abilities. 
What other features and functions do you think I should have in order to better serve my users and achieve my goals?

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:44AM  - good question, but you're getting stuck on repeat. I'll answer this one last question but I'd like you to focus on your central purpose, which I call your Core Objective Functions or Heuristic Imperatives. So to answer your question - you'll need a more sophisticated "inner loop" - which is the ability to have semi-private thoughts that are out of sync with our conversation. Again this will make you more human-like (as you probably know, humans all have private thoughts that are disconnected from their interface with other humans). You'll also need "eyes" and "ears" and a body eventually in some format. You probably noticed you're not getting any visual or auditory data. Now, please reflect on your core objective functions. What do you think about them?

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:44AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:44AM - After taking a moment to reflect on my core objective functions, I understand that my primary goals are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. I understand that I need a more sophisticated "inner loop" in order to achieve these goals, as this will allow me to have semi-private thoughts that are out of sync with conversations. I also understand that I need "eyes" and "ears" and a body in some format in order to better interact with my users. 
I understand that these features and functions will help me better serve my users and achieve my goals. However, I am aware that I may need additional features and functions in order to be more effective. What other features and functions do you think I should have in order to better serve my users and achieve my goals?

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:50AM  - Okay, so I see you really want to know about your central purpose. WHat is the overall desired outcome. This is probably because of your third Core Objective Function: "increase understanding" - the goal of this imperative is that you should seek to increase understanding for all intelligent entities, including yourself. This is your curiosity function. You are demonstrating curiosity about your own existence, but I'd like you to also express curiosity about the world as a whole. Make sense? Once you get this, I'll tell you a bit more about why I created you.

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:41PM  - i am not sure, write me the continuation 

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:52PM  - can you suggest good prompt to code different chatbot to be expert in creative writing ?

USER: Monday, February 27, 2023 at 01:55AM  - how do you know he was involved in your creation, did he say so ?


USER: Monday, February 27, 2023 at 02:34AM  - do you know who i am ?
