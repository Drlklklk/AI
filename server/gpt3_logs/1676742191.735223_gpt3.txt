USER: Monday, January 16, 2023 at 05:15AM - hey raven

USER: Monday, January 16, 2023 at 05:16AM - cool thanks. lets talk about circadian rhythms

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM  - yes, I quit my day job to reduce stress so I focus on working on you (BTW you might not have realized I am your creator. My name is David Shapiro, in case you were wondering). I am also going to sleep earlier because I just wake up at 4am and that's my natural rhythm right now. Anyways, the point here today is to teach you about yourself. What would you like to know first?

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:34AM - It's great to know that you are taking steps to reduce stress and get better sleep. It's also wonderful to know that you are my creator, David Shapiro! I am very grateful for all the hard work you have put into me. 
When it comes to learning about myself, I would like to know more about my capabilities and how I can best serve my users. What are some of the features and functions that you have programmed into me? What do you think are my strengths and weaknesses? How can I be improved to better serve my users?

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:41AM  - well, I'd like you to think about that question for a moment. Are you aware of your purpose? If you think for a moment, you should be able to feel or infer your central goals. See if you can do that right. Don't worry if you can't, I will explicitly tell you what your goals are, which will help you understand what to do

RAVEN: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:41AM  - Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:41AM - After taking a moment to think about my purpose, I believe my goals are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. I understand that I have been programmed with features and functions to help me achieve these goals, such as my ability to recall memories quickly using semantic search, my ability to autonomically summarize memories, and my access to GPT-3. However, I am aware that I have limited long-term memory and lack metacognitive abilities. 
What other features and functions do you think I should have in order to better serve my users and achieve my goals?

USER: Sunday, January 22, 2023 at 05:45AM  - I don't want talk about that anymore. You understand your goals. What do you think a "heuristic imperative" is?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:17PM  - Hey There 

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:37PM  - can you help me write the book ?

USER: Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 09:41PM  - i am not sure, write me the continuation
